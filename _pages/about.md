Bio
======

I am a postdoctoral fellow affiliated with the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS) & the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics (T-5) groups at Los Alamos National Laboratory. My mentors at LANL are Deepjyoti Deka, Harsha Nagarajan, and Russell Bent. Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at UW-Madison where I was fortunate to be advised by Jim Luedtke. I obtained my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from MIT where I worked with Paul Barton. <br/>

I am broadly interested in **data-driven decision-making under uncertainty** with application to energy and chemical process systems. My research interests include *integrated machine learning and optimization under uncertainty*, *scalable solution methods for stochastic optimization*, and *deterministic global optimization*.
