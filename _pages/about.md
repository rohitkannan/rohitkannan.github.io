Bio
======

I am a postdoctoral fellow with the <a href = "https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Center for Nonlinear Studies</a> and <a href = "https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/applied-mathematics-plasma-physics/index.php" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Applied Mathematics & Plasma Physics</a> (T-5) groups at Los Alamos National Laboratory. My LANL mentors are <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepjyoti-deka-8a44388" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Deepjyoti Deka</a>, <a href = "https://harshanagarajan.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Harsha Nagarajan</a>, and <a href = "https://public.lanl.gov/rbent/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Russell Bent</a>. Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at UW-Madison where I was fortunate to work with <a href = "https://jrluedtke.github.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Jim Luedtke</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from MIT where I worked in the <a href = "https://yoric.mit.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Barton lab</a>. <br/>

I am broadly interested in **data-driven decision-making under uncertainty** with application to energy and chemical process systems. My research interests include *integrated learning and optimization*, scalable *stochastic optimization*, and theory and algorithms for *deterministic global optimization*.
