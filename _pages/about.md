I am broadly interested in theory and algorithms for data-driven decision-making under uncertainty with application to energy and chemical process systems. My research interests include approaches for integrating learning and optimization, deterministic global optimization, and the designing scalable methods for large-scale optimization problems.

Recent News:

November 2020: I will be presenting the following works at the 2020 virtual "INFORMS Annual Meeting"
"Data-driven Sample Average Approximation with Covariate Information" in Session TD11 on "Data, Statistics and Learning in Energy System Optimization" (link:https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9022/session/2220)
"Stochastic DC Optimal Power Flow with Reserve Saturation" in Session ThC38 on "Optimization in Energy Systems under Uncertainty" (link: https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9022/session/2845)
October 2020: Paper on "Stochastic Approximation for Chance-Constrained Nonlinear Programs" has been accepted for publication in "Mathematical Programming Computation"

September 2020: Here are slides from a talk I gave at Argonne National Laboratory

August 2020: I presented a poster at the "Second Annual Wisconsin Institute for Discovery Symposium" (link: https://wid.wisc.edu/wid-symposium/posters/)

July 2020: I gave a talk at Los Alamos National Laboratory

February 2020: I gave a short talk and presented a poster at the IPAM 2020 Workshop on "Intersections between Control, Learning and Optimization" (http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/)
