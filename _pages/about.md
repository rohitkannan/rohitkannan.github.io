**Research Interests**

I am broadly interested in **data-driven decision-making under uncertainty** with application to *energy and chemical process systems*. My research interests include *integrated machine learning and optimization under uncertainty*, *deterministic global optimization*, and *scalable solution methods for stochastic optimization*.


**Recent News:**

**November 2020:** I will be presenting two papers at the virtual 2020 INFORMS Annual Meeting
* *Data-driven Sample Average Approximation with Covariate Information* in <br/> [Session TD11:](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9022/session/2220) *Data, Statistics and Learning in Energy System Optimization* <a href = "https://rohitkannan.github.io/presentations/Kannan_INFORMS20_DDSAA.pdf" target="_blank">[Slides]</a>
* *Stochastic DC Optimal Power Flow with Reserve Saturation* in <br/> [Session ThC38:](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9022/session/2845) *Optimization in Energy Systems under Uncertainty* <a href = "https://rohitkannan.github.io/presentations/Kannan_INFORMS20_SDCOPF.pdf" target="_blank">[Slides]</a>

**October 2020:** Paper on *Stochastic Approximation for Chance-Constrained Nonlinear Programs* has been accepted for publication in *Mathematical Programming Computation* <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07066" target="_blank">[Preprint]</a>

**August 2020:** I presented a poster on *Integrated Learning and Optimization* at the [Third Annual Wisconsin Institute for Discovery Symposium](https://wid.wisc.edu/wid-symposium/)

**July 2020:** I presented my work to the ANSI group at Los Alamos National Laboratory

**March 2020:** My research on *Stochastic DC Optimal Power Flow with Reserve Saturation* with Jim and Line was featured on the UW-Madison <a href = "https://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/power-tools-new-math-model-optimizes-energy/" target="_blank">[College of Engineering News Website] </a>

**February 2020:** I gave a short talk and presented a poster on *Predict, then smart optimize with stochastic programming* at the [IPAM 2020 Workshop](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/) on Intersections between Control, Learning and Optimization <a href = "https://rohitkannan.github.io/presentations/Kannan_IPAM20_DDSAA.pdf" target="_blank">[Poster]</a>
