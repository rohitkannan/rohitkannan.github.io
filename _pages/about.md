Research Interests
======

I am broadly interested in **data-driven decision-making under uncertainty** with application to *energy and chemical process systems*. My research interests include *integrated machine learning and optimization under uncertainty*, *deterministic global optimization*, and *scalable solution methods for stochastic optimization*.
