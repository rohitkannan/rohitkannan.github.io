    <p>Viability of branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithms
        B&B algorithms provide the main theoretical framework for solving nonconvex problems to global optimality. Their major drawback is that they can take exponentially many iterations in the search space dimension to converge. Reduced-space B&B algorithms mitigate this issue by working in a low-dimensional subspace. They can be effective in solving stochastic programs. I built a general theory to identify properties that a B&B algorithm must possess to be computationally tractable. I discovered that reduced-space algorithms may be impractical unless auxiliary techniques are used to boost their performance. I used these insights to design an efficient reduced-space B&B algorithm for two-stage stochastic programs.</p>
